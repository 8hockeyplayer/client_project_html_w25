                <p>The Shapiro Library, which is also known as the UGLI, is one of the best spots for undergraduate students to study regardless of program. As one of the largest libraries on campus is contains a plethora of great study spots and is open for 24 hours 5 days a week. With its fairly central location and many group spaces it is one of the best spots to meet for group projects. The only real downside is that it can sometimes be quite busy, particularly during prime study hours </p>

                <p>The Michigan Union is another top study spot that UMSI students can take advantage of. One of the best parts about the Union is the diversity of spots and the ability to grab something to eat while you're there. The Union contains a variety of different popular restraunts that students can grab food from while they study. This makes the Union a popular spot, especailly later in the day or around lunch time.</p>
