            <h2>UMSI Dedicated Tutoring</h2>
            <div>
                <p>At UMSI we have a deidcated <a href = "https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/umsitutoring/home?authuser=1">tutoring site</a> allowing UMSI students to get dedicated tutors to help with their coursework. These tutors have a wealth of experience in programming and math based fields, and are more than willing to help with any difficulties you may experience. Each of these peer tutors have taken UMSI classes in the past and are familiar with the program and questions you will need to answer. For more information we invite you to contact the peer tutoring program at <a href= "mailto:umsi.academicsuccess@umich.edu">umsi.academicsuccess@umich.edu</a>.</p>

            <h2>Additional Tutoring Help</h2>
            <div>
                <p>While UMSI tutors are a great resource, there are other ways to get acadmeic support as well. Your professors and GSI's will host office hours weekly and are more than willing to help students. The University of Michigan as a whole also provides academic support through university wide tutoring services, the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/sweetland/">Sweetland Center for Writing</a>, <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/course-resources/math-lab.html">Math Lab</a>, and the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/slc">Science Learning Center</a> which all provide help for a designated subject area and are open to all students. If your subject doesn't seem to fall into these categories, dont give up! There are similar resources for most subjects on campus.</p>
